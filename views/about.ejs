      <h2 class="aboutH2">I am a web developer in the greater Seattle area with a passion for the outdoors, travel and family. I have held many different positions in a diverse set of industries. Through these I know how to learn new skills quickly and how to stay calm when in stressful situations. I work well in teams as well as on my own and I enjoy learning and mastering any subject. I hope to bring a hard working, calm, and resourceful member to any company.</h2>
